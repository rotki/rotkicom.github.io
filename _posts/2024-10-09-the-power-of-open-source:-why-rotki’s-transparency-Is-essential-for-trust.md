In an era where data [privacy](https://blog.rotki.com/2024/09/10/the-importance-of-privacy-in-a-crypto-portfolio-management-tool/) and security are at the forefront of our digital lives, transparency has become a key factor in building trust. For individuals managing cryptocurrency portfolios, trust is not just a preference—it’s a necessity. This is where [rotki](https://rotki.com/), an open-source portfolio tracking and management tool, sets itself apart from competitors by emphasizing transparency as a core value.

## What Does Open Source Mean?

An open-source project makes its source code public so that any person can see it, alter it, or even go so far as to contribute to the codebase. An important part of being open source means allowing others to build their products on top of yours. For more check the [OSI definition](https://opensource.org/osd). In the context of rotki, this means everything in terms of the inner workings of the software being open to anyone who wants to inspect them. This means that users do not have to take the word of the company for anything; they can inspect the code independently or use independent, third-party reviews by security researchers to ensure there are no hidden vulnerabilities or data-handling practices that might compromise their privacy.


## Why Transparency is Important in Crypto Portfolio Management

Cryptocurrency was founded on decentralization and user empowerment. Crypto users usually want tools that enable full control over their money and data. Open source allows complete transparency where no decision-making about your security or information will be hidden from you; everything is in the open for you to see and understand. Transparency is of utmost importance in software like rotki for the following reasons:
1. **Trust Through Code Inspection:** Because it is open source, everybody has the opportunity to inspect said software for its intended workings without any backdoors or hidden security risks. In this case, users of rotki can verify that their financial data will stay on their device and not be sent to third parties. That alone gives peace of mind to the user as their sensitive information is safe.
2. **No hidden backdoors:** Open-source software means removing any threat of hidden backdoors that can leak your data. With closed-sourced software, users are not sure their information will be secure. Even companies that you can trust can fall prey to security breaches. Rotki being open-source by nature makes everything at least visible, and hence there's little room for doubt about its integrity.
3. **Community Contributions:** The success of any open-source project is dependent on community contributions. Bug reporting, active improvement suggestions, and even code contributions mean rotki is constantly improving. This will keep the software updated, secure, and receptive to the users' needs. The more eyes look at the code, the faster bugs can be found and fixed, hence rotki gets more bullet-proof with time.
4. **Innovation through Transparency:** Free and open-source software allows any developer to start working on projects based on code that already exists. Using the case of rotki, for example, people can build new features and even completely new tools on top. That means rotki evolves with the community, updating at every turn based on the input and ideas of its users.
5. **Aligned with Decentralization:** Decentralization is central to cryptocurrency, and open-source software aligns with this principle. Rotki’s transparency ensures users aren’t tied to one company. They can access the code, modify it, and develop it independently. This gives users more control and freedom, so they’re not limited by one company's rules.


## Rotki: Example of Open Source Done Right
Rotki goes beyond being a typical portfolio management tool by fully embracing open-source principles to empower its users. Here's what makes it unique:
1. **Data Privacy:** All your financial data remains on your device. Rotki does not store or process your data on its servers, and this promise can be independently verified by taking a look at its source code.
2. **Community-driven:** Contributions come in from users all over the world. Be it feature requests, bugs, or even writing code, the community drives how [rotki](https://rotki.com/) evolves.
3. **Security by Transparency:** The basis of security in rotki lies in the very fact that the community can always audit and verify the codebase so no malicious practice goes unnoticed, including data siphoning and unauthorized access.
